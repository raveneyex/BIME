# ToDo

### BUGS
* Fix Layout
* CSS in JS? Do.

## Design

* Find typography and apply app-wide

* Check BEM
    * Possibly refactor className in whole app to follow BEM.

## Code

* Refactor `App.js`

* Add Selection to PeriodMovements
* Fully bind actions to UI

* Add TabIndex
* Add formater to value input
* Add formater to date input
* Add placeholders to inputs

* Modify ActionCreators 1: Create a fn() that expects a dispatch method and returns an object with actions that have dispatch available.

* Modify ActionCreators 2: Include Validations.
    * This implies adding VALIDATION ACTIONS.

## Architecture

* Do not include extension on `import` statements;

* Do not use `"` for strings

* Create a very strict linter 
   * All props have defaults.
