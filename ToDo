# ToDo

## Design

* Find typography and apply app-wide

* Design Components:
    * Movement Type
    * Movements
    * Period Info

* Check BEM
    * Possibly refactor className in whole app to follow BEM.

## Code

* Make PeriodList & Period the containers.
    * App is dumb.

* Fully bind actions to UI

* Add TabIndex

* Add formater to value input
* Add formater to date input

* Modify ActionCreators 1: Create a fn() that expects a dispatch method and returns an object with actions that have dispatch available.

* Modify ActionCreators 2: Include Validations.
    * This implies adding VALIDATION ACTIONS.

## Architecture

* Do not include extension on `import` statements;

* Do not use `"` for strings

* Create a very strict linter 
    * only one prop ? destructuring on component's signature : destructuring inside fn.
