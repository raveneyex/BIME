# ToDo

    * Design Components:
        * Movement
        * Period
        * PeriodList
        * App

    * Make PeriodList & Period the containers.
        * App is dumb.
    
    * Fully bind actions to UI

    * Check BEM
        * Possibly refactor className in whole app to follow BEM.

    * Modify ActionCreators 1: Create a fn() that expects a dispatch method and returns an object with actions that have dispatch available.

    * Modify ActionCreators 2: Include Validations.
        * This implies adding VALIDATION ACTIONS. 
    
## Style Cleanups

* Do not include extension on `import` statements;
* Do not use `"` for strings
* Create a very strict linter 
    *only one prop ? destructuring on component's signature : destructuring inside fn.
